    "# Symbol - Neural network graphs and auto-differentiation\n",
    "\n",
    "In a [previous tutorial](http://mxnet.io/tutorials/basic/ndarray.html), we introduced `NDArray`,\n",
    "the basic data structure for manipulating data in MXNet.\n",
    "And just using NDArray by itself, we can execute a wide range of mathematical operations.\n",
    "In fact, we could define and update a full neural network just by using `NDArray`.\n",
    "`NDArray` allows you to write programs for scientific computation\n",
    "in an imperative fashion, making full use of the native control of any front-end language.\n",
    "So you might wonder, why don't we just use `NDArray` for all computation?\n",
    "\n",
    "MXNet provides the Symbol API, an interface for symbolic programming.\n",
    "With symbolic programming, rather than executing operations step by step,\n",
    "we first define a *computation graph*.\n",
    "This graph contains placeholders for inputs and designated outputs.\n",
    "We can then compile the graph, yielding a function\n",
    "that can be bound to `NDArray`s and run.\n",
    "MXNet's Symbol API is similar to the network configurations\n",
    "used by [Caffe](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/)\n",
    "and the symbolic programming in [Theano](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Another advantage conferred by symbolic approach is that\n",
    "we can optimize our functions before using them.\n",
    "For example, when we execute mathematical computations in imperative fashion,\n",
    "we don't know at the time that we run each operation,\n",
    "which values will be needed later on.\n",
    "But with symbolic programming, we declare the required outputs in advance.\n",
    "This means that we can recycle memory allocated in intermediate steps,\n",
    "as by performing operations in place. Symbolic API also uses less memory for the\n",
    "same network. Refer to [How To](http://mxnet.io/how_to/index.html) and\n",
    "[Architecture](http://mxnet.io/architecture/index.html) section to know more.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our design notes, we present [a more thorough discussion on the comparative strengths\n",
    "of imperative and symbolic programing](http://mxnet.io/architecture/program_model.html).\n",
    "But in this document, we'll focus on teaching you how to use MXNet's Symbol API.\n",
    "In MXNet, we can compose Symbols from other Symbols, using operators,\n",
    "such as simple matrix operations (e.g. \"+\"),\n",
    "or whole neural network layers (e.g. convolution layer).\n",
    "Operator can take multiple input variables,\n",
    "can produce multiple output symbols\n",
    "and can maintain internal state symbols.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a visual explanation of these concepts, see\n",
    "[Symbolic Configuration and Execution in Pictures](http://mxnet.io/api/python/symbol_in_pictures.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "To make things concrete, let's take a hands-on look at the Symbol API.\n",
    "There are a few different ways to compose a `Symbol`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "To complete this tutorial, we need:\n",
    "\n",
    "- MXNet. See the instructions for your operating system in [Setup and Installation](http://mxnet.io/get_started/install.html)\n",
    "- [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    pip install jupyter\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "- GPUs - A section of this tutorial uses GPUs. If you don't have GPUs on your machine, simply\n",
    "set the variable gpu_device to mx.cpu().\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic Symbol Composition\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "The following example builds a simple expression: `a + b`.\n",
    "First, we create two placeholders with  `mx.sym.Variable`,\n",
    "giving them the names `a` and `b`.\n",
    "We then construct the desired symbol by using the operator `+`.\n",
    "We don't need to name our variables while creating them,\n",
    "MXNet will automatically generate a unique name for each.\n",
    "In the example below, `c` is assigned a unique name automatically."
